# Self Driving Car

This model is trained on Udacity's Self Driving Car simulator. It uses the behavioural cloning technique to achieve it's purpose. 

The results were fairly good. It could drive around the track without any issues. 

To make it work, download the model.h5 file and the drive.py file. Put them both in the same folder and run the drive.py file. Now, start the simulator, select a track and run it in autonomous mode. The car should start moving.
